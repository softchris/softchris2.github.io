# Organizer
Currently I organize 6 meetup groups for over 3000 developers.. In truth co organizers and the people who attend makes me better. It is a privilege to stand in front of you each and everytime and present something inspiring.

I live in London nowadays so it's mostly the meetups here that I have time to actively manage.

Here are my groups:

[London Javascript](https://www.meetup.com/London-Javascript/)

[Nativescript London](https://www.meetup.com/NativeScript-London/)

[Frontend Gbg](https://www.meetup.com/Frontend-Gbg/)

[Software Craftsmanship Goteborg](https://www.meetup.com/Software-Craftsmanship-Goteborg/)

[Angular Gothenburg](https://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Gothenburg/)

[Angular Stockholm](https://www.meetup.com/ngStockholm/)


I am also one of the organizer for Angular Conference ngVikings, [ngVikings](https://ngvikings.org/)
